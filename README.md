README: Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and LSTM
 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on time series forecasting using ARIMA (classical statistical method) and LSTM (modern deep learning approach). The tutorial is applied to the Airline Passengers dataset from Kaggle, covering theory, implementation, and comparative analysis.
